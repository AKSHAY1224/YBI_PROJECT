# 📊 Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts **Sales** based on **TV advertising budget** using **Simple Linear Regression**.  
Created during my internship at **YBI Foundation**.

---

## 📁 Overview
- Dataset: Advertising data (TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales)
- Goal: Understand how advertising budget affects sales
- Best predictor: **TV advertising**

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data loading & inspection  
2. Outlier analysis  
3. Scatter plots, pairplots & heatmap  
4. Building simple linear regression using `statsmodels`  
5. Model evaluation using **RMSE** and **R² score**  
6. Residual analysis & visualization  

---

## 📐 Final Regression Model
\[
\text{Sales} = 6.948 + 0.054 \times \text{TV}
\]

- TV has a strong positive impact on Sales  
- Train R² ≈ **0.81**  
- Test R² ≈ **0.68**

---

## 📈 Conclusion
There is a clear **positive linear relationship** between TV advertising and Sales.  
Increasing TV advertisement budget leads to higher sales.
